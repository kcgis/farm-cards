# Kendall County Farm Card Calculations

## Overview
The purpose of this repository is to openly document the means by which farmland cards are calculated in Kendall County, and to make those methods available to the general public, both for possible replication elsewhere and for accountability to County residents.

This repository does *not* detail the *valuation* of farm parcels. The particulars of that process are the purview of the [Assessment Office](https://www.co.kendall.il.us/offices/assessments), and further inquiries in such matters can be directed there.
