# Kendall County Farm Card Calculations

## Overview
The purpose of this repository is to openly document the means by which farmland cards are calculated in Kendall County, and to make those methods available to the general public, both for possible replication elsewhere and for accountability to County residents.

This repository does *not* detail the *valuation* of farm parcels as it applies to Kendall County specifically, though the general process is described in the `farm-cards.ipynb` notebook.

The valuation process is the purview of the [Assessment Office](https://kendallcountyil.gov/offices/assessments), and further inquiries in such matters can be directed there.

## The *Actual* Process

If you are here because you want to know what Kendall County GIS is actually using for our farm cards, see the file `farm_cards.py`.
